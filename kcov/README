Kcov - code coverage

Kcov is a code coverage tester for compiled programs, Python 
scripts and shell scripts. 
It allows collecting code coverage information from executables 
without special command-line arguments, and continuosly produces 
output from long-running applications.
Using kcov is as simple as
  $ kcov /path/to/outdir executable [args for the executable]
